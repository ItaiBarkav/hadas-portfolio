      <mat-card-content>
        I am a driven, passionate, and eager designer, with 3 years of
        experience. <br />
        <b>I currently work for the Israeli Navy</b> where I specialize in
        complex systems which is a true passion of mine. I enjoy collaborating
        with other designers and developers and learning from them. <br />
        Iâ€™m also a 2nd year
        <b> psychology student at the Open University.</b> The knowledge I gain
        in my studies helps tremendously to understand human behavior and its
        flaws and allows me to create better user experiences.
